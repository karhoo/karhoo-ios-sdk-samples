# iOS Samples for Karhoo SDKs

Samples demonstrating how to use
[Karhoo SDKs for iOS](https://developer.karhoo.com/docs/build-apps-using-sdks).

1. [network-sdk-swiftui-sample](network-sdk-swiftui-sample): An experimental simple app showing most features of the [Karhoo Network SDK](https://developer.karhoo.com/docs/using-the-network-sdk) for SwiftUI.
2. [ui-sdk-components-sample](ui-sdk-components-sample): A simple app showing usage examples of Karhoo components found in the KarhooUISDK for UIKit and an experimental SwiftUI target.


> **_NOTE:_**  Karhoo SDKs were designed for UIKit, SwiftUI support and samples are experimental and a work in progress. They are designed to be a starting point guide for further support in 2021/22 as iOS 13 slowly becomes the minimum support version over time. If you have a SwiftUI application and require further support please don't hesitate to raise an issue for support so we may prioritise it.
